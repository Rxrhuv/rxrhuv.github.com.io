        <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Robenel Josue. I'm 23 years old and was born on October 24, 2000. I live in Tampus, Boac, Marinduque. I love spending time in nature and riding motorcycles. Nature trips are my favorite. I enjoy hiking in forests, chilling by rivers, and looking at mountains. It's peaceful and makes me happy. I also like riding motorcycles. Feeling the wind on my face as I ride is amazing. Join me as I explore nature and enjoy motorcycle rides!</p>

        <h4>Background on Information Technology</h4>
        <p>Information technology (IT) is all about using computers and technology to manage and process information. It includes things like computers, software, networks, and databases. In IT, people learn how to design, build, and use technology to solve problems and make things work better. It's a big field with lots of different areas to explore, like programming, cybersecurity, and web development. As technology continues to advance, the field of IT keeps growing and changing, offering new opportunities and challenges for those who study it.</p>
        <p>As a student, my vision of information technology is like being a digital wizard, where I use computers and tech to make amazing things happen. It's like having a superpower to solve puzzles, create cool stuff, and make life easier for people. In IT, I get to dive into the world of computers, learning how they work and how to make them do what I want. It's exciting to think about all the possibilities, from building apps that connect people around the world to designing websites that showcase creativity. In my vision, information technology is not just about machines and code; it's about using technology to shape the future and make a positive impact on the world.</p>
